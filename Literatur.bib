We demonstrate how the principal axes of a set of observed data vectors may be determined through maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in a latent variable model that is closely related to factor analysis. We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.},

	abstract = {A selective review of the statistical analysis of time series is given, attention being concentrated on methods for the interpretation of data as contrasted with methods for empirical forecasting. Ways of describing second-order properties are compared and the distinction between short-range and long-range dependency outlined. Estimation of second-order functions is reviewed in model-free and model-specific contexts. Criteria for model choice and goodness of fit are discussed. Analysis of replicated series is mentioned. Some aspects of nonGaussian theory are developed. The possibility of an exponential family theory of time series is outlined and also some aspects of nonlinear processes. The distinction between reversible and irreversible processes is emphasized. Techniques for handling nonstationary processes are compared, dealing both with nonstationarity in mean and nonstationarity in structure. Finally there are some fairly brief remarks on multiple time series analysis, especially on the regression analysis of one response series on several explanatory series.},

It is subject to estimation error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. Instead, a matrix can be obtained from the sample covariance matrix through a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients toward more central values, systematically reducing estimation error when it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage intensity. Shrinkage reduces portfolio tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially raises the manager{\textquoteright}s realized information ratio.},

In this paper we provide an overview of some existing techniques for discovering such embeddings. We then introduce a novel probabilistic interpretation of principal component analysis (PCA) that we term dual probabilistic PCA (DPPCA). The DPPCA model has the additional advantage that the linear mappings from the embedded space can easily be non-linearised through Gaussian processes. We refer to this model as a Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM). Through analysis of the GP-LVM objective function, we relate the model to popular spectral techniques such as kernel PCA and multidimensional scaling. We then review a practical algorithm for GP-LVMs in the context of large data sets and develop it to also handle discrete valued data and missing attributes. We demonstrate the model on a range of real-world and artificially generated data sets.},

The arbitrage model was proposed as an alternative to the mean variance capital asset pricing model, introduced by Sharpe, Lintner, and Treynor, that has become the major analytic tool for explaining phenomena observed in capital markets for risky assets. The principal relation that emerges from the mean variance model holds that for any asset, i, its (ex ante) expected return \$E\_i = p + \lamdba b\_i, \kern+100pt (1)\$ where ρ is the riskless rate of interest, is the expected excess return on the market, Em − ρ, and \$ b\_i - \,\sigma \_{im}^2 /\sigma \_m^2 , \$ is the beta coefficient on the market, where σm2 is the variance of the market portfolio and \$ \sigma \_{im}^2 \$ is the covariance between the returns on the ith asset and the market portfolio. (If a riskless asset does not exist, ρ is the zero-beta return, i.e., the return on all portfolios uncorrelated with the market portfolio)… },

Because these patterns in average returns apparently are not explained by the CAPM, they are called anomalies. We find that, except for the continuation of short-term returns, the anomalies largely disappear in a three-factor model. Our results are consistent with rational ICAPM or APT asset pricing, but we also consider irrational pricing and data problems as possible explanations.},

	abstract = { Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular techniques for processing, compressing, and visualizing data, although its effectiveness is limited by its global linearity. While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Therefore, previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have been ad hoc to some extent. In this article, PCA is formulated within a maximum likelihood framework, based on a specific form of gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analyzers, whose parameters can be determined using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modeling, and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition. }

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous technique for data analysis and processing, but one which is not based on a probability model. We demonstrate how the principal axes of a set of observed data vectors may be determined through maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in a latent variable model that is closely related to factor analysis. We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.},

	abstract = "We present a new method for the numerical simulation of lattice field theory. A hybrid (molecular dynamics/Langevin) algorithm is used to guide a Monte Carlo simulation. There are no discretization errors even for large step sizes. The method is especially efficient for systems such as quantum chromodynamics which contain fermionic degrees of freedom. Detailed results are presented for four-dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics including the dynamical effects of electrons."
